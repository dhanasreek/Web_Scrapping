However, that's a great plus point. long wire makes recording more easier.-It has a Velcro for cable management. So, not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control.-weighs around 100gms-There are no batteries included-There's a switch ON/OFF button. While recording You need to switch to CAMERA MODE(Don't really know why its written camera)SOUND QUALITY-My recordings have improved considerably with this Mic and I am loving it.-Just one complain I have. It captures lot of air flow meaning I can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output.Even If I record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance I can hear my breathing sounds.-Sound quality is loud enough and crisp.-It does capture my room's ceiling fan sound. So, I can hear that whoosh sound in the background when I am plugged into my earphones.-I record with the AC on and keep the fan switched off.Also, It comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely(yaayyy).So, finally Best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output.\",\n",

       " '  I will give my honest review on Boya M1. Read this full and i may help you clear your dilemma. If you need in depth review i have a review video on youtube. go to youtube . com / mobiletechpoint or search for \"mobile tech point Boya M1\" and you will find the review video. Audio for the Entire video has been recorded with Boya M1.1. I bought Boya M1 for 800 rupees. So this is a great pro mic for the price.2. first thing we notice is that the cable is 6 meters long which is super lengthy. So You have to be good in cable management. It is nice to see that battery unit is made of metal. If you use the mic with smartphones you don’t need a battery because the mic draws the power from the phone. But in case of dslr, you need to switch to camera mode. Good part of this mic is that it can connect with smartphones, tablets, pc, dslr’s  and external audio recorders like zoom h1n. That’s pretty awesome right?3. For the price we pay, this mic gives you excellent quality audio. Having a 6-meter cable can be an advantage or disadvantage, it depends on how you look at it. If you are using the mic with external recorder you don’t need a 6m cable, but if you are using the mic with a dslr camera and if you want to move around, it gives you all the freedom. The other only concern that you need to be aware of is, since there is no battery indicator you might want to carry an extra battery. If you are going to record something important which you don’t want to miss at all, put in a new battery and you will be fine.4. If you are into audio recording, then Boya M1 lavalier mic is a must have. Even if you have an external audio recorder or a condenser mic, get this mic as well. I am sure this will come in handy at some point of time.If you have any doubts, post a comment on my youtube video i will answer your query. Thanks. Buy this!',\n",

       " \"  Ok. So this product after I purchased, didn't give me a genuine product tag from Boya. Unlike all other boya lapel boxes, this one has a colorful QR code. Is this legit? I tried scanning and putting the Security code in Boya Site itself. It said no data found. Tried many times. I then also tried to check the product by putting a lr44 battery which I had. And used it on my DSLR input. It was only noise captured. My voice went totally missing. I checked that the switch was towards 'Cameras' only. The box also had a pricing sticker behind which said, 1650. Genuine boxes don't put such things. I never got a genuine feel at all thought the product make looks as same as what it should be. There was a boya logo on product too which was strange & at a wrong place. I straight away returned the product the next day itself. Maybe I got a duplicate product than what others may not have. Check well after you buy it.\",\n",
       " \"  It's a good mic. Does the job fine. The cable is tooo long. It would be better if there was a good way to manage the cable length.Works well with smartphone too. The mic seems to be little too sensitive.It is picking up background noise at more intensity than the cheapest lavalier mic available or the usual mic on your ear phones.So this mic is not much useful if you are in a noisy environment.But the audio quality is really good and rich compared to headphone mic or those cheap lavalier mics.\",\n",
       " '  Earlier, I was having a generic mic (₹117) but that has poor voice recording quality and short cable. I bought this Boya Mic to increase the quality of the recording and it does what it says. The voice quality is very good. Build quality is above average. The mic can be used with DSLR cameras. The mic has control panel attched to the cable which is powered by a LR series cell. You can switch between camera and mobile by a button. Overall the mic is great in terms of value for money and voice recording quality.Cons:1. The cable is extremely long and tangles very easily.2. The standard camera app may not support external mic so you can download third party app like open camera.',\n",

       " \"  Ok. So this product after I purchased, didn't give me a genuine product tag from Boya. Unlike all other boya lapel boxes, this one has a colorful QR code. Is this legit? I tried scanning and putting the Security code in Boya Site itself. It said no data found. Tried many times. I then also tried to check the product by putting a lr44 battery which I had. And used it on my DSLR input. It was only noise captured. My voice went totally missing. I checked that the switch was towards 'Cameras' only. The box also had a pricing sticker behind which said, 1650. Genuine boxes don't put such things. I never got a genuine feel at all thought the product make looks as same as what it should be. There was a boya logo on product too which was strange & at a wrong place. I straight away returned the product the next day itself. Maybe I got a duplicate product than what others may not have. Check well after you buy it.\",\n",

The mic has control panel attched to the cable which is powered by a LR series cell. You can switch between camera and mobile by a button.

BUYERS CAN PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT ONE'S OWN RISK AND WITHOUT EXPECTATION OF ANY AFTER SALES SUPPORT.I do not thinking, this boya mic is of any use. I purchased a Y splitter in Rs. 200/- and I can use any microphone including Boya By M1 (without using the switch et all) with very ease. A thoroughly misrepresented item. A simple Lapel mic with Y spliter is a far far better option then this very expensive and inconvenient Boya BY M1.\",\n",
       " '  NOTE :@ Its ready to go Mic, which doesn\\'t need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones.* Has 3.5mm jack connector built in, you can use 1/4\\' connector if needed.@ It has very Long cable which measures upto 20 feet, so note that.@ It has absolutely NO noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in STOCK condition, but with SIMPLE EDITING this mic works just fine ( Check the review below for detailed settings )There are literally thousands of review on this product, but NONE explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with Audacity software, or even in general. So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. So I went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.First I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settings,PROS :-------1. Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. Length of cable is insane (20 feet).* I personally didn\\'t find it useful, as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera.3. Has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. Its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn\\'t need any sound card or external device to work.5. Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers.6. It comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.CONS :--------1. Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. Its just garbage quality and even normal ears can\\'t bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. My normal smartphone\\'s earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users. I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there\\'s NO way to know whether the battery is dead or what\\'s its charging level. Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn\\'t has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! I am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence I am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.BEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE :===================================These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software, which is Free !1. Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. Select entire audio clip and open \"Effects\" and then \" DISTORTION \"3. Start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.Now select \" Distortion Type \" option on the top of box and select \" Soft Clipping \".* or select \" Hard Limiter \" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. Take the \"Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. Adjust the \"Make-up Gain\" cursor little bit if needed, I keep it on 49.* Here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. Now just click \" APPLY \".8. Now is Noise reduction. For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice, but ONLY has background noises that you don\\'t want.9. Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \"10. Click on \" Get Noise Profile\".11. Now select entire audio clip and again Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \".12. Finally, click on \" OK \" and that\\'s it !Now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output. After these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.VERDICT :-----------I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. Plus price seems slightly more on this. I wouldn\\'t recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. Buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.',\n",

       " \"  \\xa0Hi, I read the other reviews of this mic on amazon, YouTube. Mostly all are good so, I decided to buy it.First time, an already opened box was delivered, so I asked for replacement. Amazon quickly replaced my product and I received a packed one this time.This mic is not at all good for the price. The sound recorded is bad and low quality. It appears to be recorded on cheap quality mic present in earphones. My normal Logitech USB headset mic is working better than this.About noise cancellation:Yes it is cancelling the noise. But it is very harsh. During noise cancellation, it also reduces the quality of original voice. And thus we get a low quality voice. Unfortunately there is no option to turn off noise cancellation.Recommendation:If we want quality, I would suggest go for a good quality headset. It's voice would be clearer than this.Cons:- Very harsh noise cancellation, which reduces quality of actual voice.- 20 feel cable is so long. (it is both a pro and a con)- A little on heavier side- Voice quality is not good.Pros:- 20 Feet cable- Comes with 5.5 adapter to plugin into amplifier and other instruments- Build quality is amazing- Comes with a clip and cushion.- Comes with a small pouch.- Can be used on a camera.- Noise cancellationI've decided to return the product.\",\n",

They are fooling customers .Those who are reading this review its your  decision , I m just giving my feedback. I have returned that product in refund policy but did not get refund money till the  date. I have tried each and every way out but no result . Finally I am writing this review.

Extremely unhappy . If you want good one go to their original website or try other good alternatives it will give you better result.

It did work very well. It has a very long wire, which might become unmanageable if you untangle it fully. however, if you open it to a descent length, then you have the flexibility of free movement as well.

       " '  This was one of the best investments in sound Ive made so far. It has great audio quality. For those of you complaining about noise, tbh, if you are in a city, you will capture noise anyhow - its not just you folks who face that problem, any pro wud face the same issue as well. Thats why most studios are built in a way which cant absorb sounds from outside - well insulated and everything.A solution for any static noise is to use a noise reduction/noise removal tool over the raw recorded file.If you find that it captures too much noise from the outside, its perhaps time to think about investing on some noise insulation/sound proofing materials - or do your recording after 1 AM or whenever your environment is quieter - or send your recorded track over to a professional sound editor who will remove all the noise for you, but remember, the editor can only do as much as what you give to work with - if the raw file has too much noise, dont expect great editing to solve all your problems - you have to try to record without capturing noise as much as u possibly can.For the price, this thing was great - it feels high quality. It came with a nice case, everything was in black and looks like something professional. If it feels pro and if it looks pro, it maybe ok to call it pro.',\n",

While it ensures that you can move around freely in the room, it might feel a little heavy.Another minor issue is the physical on/off button. You might need some getting used to.

For using this mic in these androids u need to install one application in your phone. Then only u will be able to use it. Sound quality is very clear.
